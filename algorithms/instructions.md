# Challenge 1

Implement a JavaScript function to count the occurrences of a specific character in a string.

# Example

countCharOccurrences("hello", "l") should return 2.
countCharOccurrences("banana", "a") should return 3.
countCharOccurrences("racecar", "z") should return 0.

# Challenge 2

Implement a function that checks if a given number is positive, negative, or zero and returns a corresponding string.

# Example

checkNumber(5) should return "Positive".
checkNumber(-3) should return "Negative".
checkNumber(0) should return "Zero".

# Challenge 3

Implement a function that checks if a given year is a leap year and returns a boolean.

# Example

isLeapYear(2020) should return true.
isLeapYear(2021) should return false.
isLeapYear(2000) should return true.

# Challenge 4

Implement a function that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the smallest one.

# Example

findSmallest(10, 5, 8) should return 5.
findSmallest(-3, -1, 0) should return -3.
findSmallest(7, 7, 7) should return 7.

# Challenge 5

Implement a function that classifies a temperature as "Freezing ( below 0) ," "Cold (between 0 and 10)," "Mild (between 10 and 20)," "Warm (between 20 and 30)," or "Hot (above 30)" based on a given temperature value.

# Example

classifyTemperature(0) should return "Freezing"
classifyTemperature(7) should return "Cold".
classifyTemperature(12) should return "Mild".
classifyTemperature(23) should return "Warm"
classifyTemperature(83) should return "Hot"

# Challenge 6

Implement a function fizzBuzz(input) that takes a number and retuns:
"fizz": if the number is divisible by 3
"buzz": if the number is divisible by 5
"fizzbuzz": if the number is both divisible by 3 and 5
number: if it is not divisible by 3 or 5

# Example

    fizzBuzz(3) to return "fizz"
    fizzBuzz(5) to return "buzz"
    fizzBuzz(15) to return "fizzbuzz"
    fizzBuzz(7) to return 7
